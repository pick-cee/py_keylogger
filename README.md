# KEYLOGGER - written in Python

I am transitioning from backend development to the exciting field of cybersecurity and with that I decided to try and develop an essential tool used by most hackers(ethical and unethical alike).
</br></br>

This tool basically reads the keyboard strokes of the system it has been deployed on and saves it to a text file. <br>
A keylogger is essential for capturing logs and seeing what users do with organozation's resources - **ethical hacking**.<br>
A keylogger can also be used to steathily capture users credentials to websites - **unethical hacking**.
